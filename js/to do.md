TO DO:

# Ideas
- Partial loot on fial, run out of portals
- sim life recovery for building around attrition deaths
    - design content that rewards this build by being dangerous for attritiion but not one shotty
- in addition to morale xp penalty for low level zones

# Bugs
- Capital on classname
- supposed to be 1 decimal for damage taken (death maybe isnt doing it?)
- "in the warden"
- Allocated a keystone at level 7 (supposed to be every 10)
    // Filter out already allocated passives
    const available = pool.filter(passive => 
        !gameState.exile.passives.allocated.includes(passive.id)
    ); 
    // running out of passives to allocate so are we allocating the remaining keystones early? We should add that Normal passives can be repeated and ensure ensure enough Notables for 50 levels? YEP CONFIRMED RUNNING OUT OF PASSIVES LOL

# Improvements
- Log entries should be combined for single map actions
- drop rates for gear isnt based on mission type?
- Random starting passive for each character with biasing based on class
- Reroll button needs current gold near it.

# Ideas
- Auction house with simulated non-responding traders
