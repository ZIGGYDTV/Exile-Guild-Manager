TO DO:

# Critical
- Missions are not currently mapped to difficulties, but drop chance is (defaults to easy right now), rip it out and replace with zone specific reward factors for more fun control over what missions can do.

# Ideas
- Partial loot on fial, run out of portals
- sim life recovery for building around attrition deaths
    - design content that rewards this build by being dangerous for attritiion but not one shotty
- in addition to morale xp penalty for low level zones

# Bugs
- "in the warden"
- Lost remaining health report on max hit taken calc

# Improvements
- Log entries should be combined for single map actions
- drop rates for gear isnt based on mission type?
- Random starting passive for each character with biasing based on class
- Reroll button needs current gold near it.
- xp display on exile summary
- Player damage is just "Damage", get it using same system as missions?
- Add permanent tracking of scouting info for missions  
    - Add more scouting info options
    - Add Scouting stat / skills / class
    - !IMPORTANT add scouting info to log on fail, very limited atm
- Crafting popup for items (lil craft button for window)
    - needs to show current currency not vis in exile screen



# Ideas
- Auction house with simulated non-responding traders
- last epoch crafting combo
    - break down items for an affix shard
    - unique modifiers via shards?
